To execute the program first open it in the IntelliJ IDEA and compile it, then run it by selecting the “Run” button in the top menu and then “Run Main.”  The class Main.java is where the main method is located and can be run from there.

The program will prompt the user to enter either an “m” to analyze a multi-family property or “s” to analyze a single-family property.

Next enter any positive integer value such as 1 or 200.  The data is currently hard-coded so entering any integer value will trigger the methods with the hard-coded values to display the output.
